The goal is to demodulate FM radio and read the digital RDS data.

The cl-fm-radio-rds system performs offline batch processing of FM radio signals to extract digital RDS data. The system:

1. Reads raw IQ samples from a recorded FM radio signal file (dl2048000.fm)
2. Downsamples the signal from 2.048 MHz to 256 kHz using FFT-based frequency domain filtering
3. Demodulates the FM signal to extract instantaneous frequency information
4. Isolates the 19 kHz pilot tone and 57 kHz RDS carrier using narrow-band filtering
5. Tracks carrier phase using a Digital Phase-Locked Loop (DPLL) implementation
6. Outputs processed signals as binary files for downstream analysis

The system is designed as a *research and development tool* for FM radio signal processing, not a real-time production system. All processing occurs in-memory on pre-recorded signals.
